Most of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Martin Stanek for help and guidance.
His expert advice kept me on track both during my research and while writing this thesis.

I would also like to thank Richard Ostert\'ag for providing the original idea for this thesis, although in the end it has changed quite a bit.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support.
